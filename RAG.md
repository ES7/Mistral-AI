Retrieval Augmented Generation is an AI framework that combines the capabilities of LLM and information retrieval systems. It is useful to answer questions or generate content leveraging external knowledge.
Why do we need RAG? LLMs can face a lot of challenges, it doesn’t have access to our internal document, it doesn’t have the most up to date information and it can hallucinate. One of the potential solutions for these problems is RAG.
When users ask a question about an internal document or a knowledge base, we retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base, where all the text embeddings are stored in a vector store, this step is called retrieval. Then in a prompt we include both the user query and the relevant information, so that our model can generate output based on the relevant context, this step is called generation.
